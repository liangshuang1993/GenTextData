# Add some operations to an existing pipeline.

# First, we add a horizontal flip operation to the pipeline:
p.flip_left_right(probability=0.4)

# Now we add a vertical flip operation to the pipeline:
p.flip_top_bottom(probability=0.8)

# Add a rotate90 operation to the pipeline:
p.rotate90(probability=0.1)

# Here we sample 100,000 images from the pipeline.

# It is often useful to use scientific notation for specify
# large numbers with trailing zeros.
num_of_samples = int(1e5)

# Now we can sample from the pipeline:
p.sample(num_of_samples)
